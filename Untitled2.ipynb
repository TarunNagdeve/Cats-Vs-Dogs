        "The preprocessing steps ensure that the text data is clean and normalized, making it more suitable for analysis.\n",
        "By converting text to lowercase, removing non-alphabetic characters, digits, single characters, and stopwords, you eliminate noise and irrelevant information from the text.\n",
        "Stemming and lemmatization further consolidate words to their base forms, helping to capture the semantic meaning of words more accurately.\n",
        "The TF-IDF vectorization step represents the preprocessed text data in a numerical format, considering word importance.\n",
        "Cosine similarity is computed on the TF-IDF vectors to identify texts in the dataset that are semantically similar to the preprocessed input text.\n",
        "The inference remains the same: texts in your dataset with the highest cosine similarity scores are likely to share similar content or topics with the preprocessed input text, making them potentially relevant or similar in meaning.\n",
        "The combination of these preprocessing steps, TF-IDF vectorization, stemming, lemmatization, and cosine similarity creates a robust text similarity analysis pipeline suitable for various natural language processing tasks."
