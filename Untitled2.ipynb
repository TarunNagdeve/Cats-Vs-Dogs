        "Before TF-IDF vectorization, you apply the following preprocessing steps to each text in your dataset and the input text:\n",
        "Convert all text to lowercase: Ensures consistent casing for all words.\n",
        "Remove all non-alphabetic characters: Eliminates symbols, punctuation, and special characters.\n",
        "Remove all digits: Eliminates numeric digits.\n",
        "Remove single characters: Removes single-letter words.\n",
        "Remove multiple spaces: Replaces multiple consecutive spaces with a single space.\n",
        "Remove stopwords: Eliminates common words (e.g., \"the,\" \"and,\" \"in\") that do not carry significant meaning.\n",
        "Apply stemming and lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root forms, consolidating similar words.\n",
